Hudson SOLO Liquid Handler
==========================

The SOLO Liquid Handler is an automated liquid handling system developed by Hudson Robotics. It is designed to streamline and automate liquid handling tasks in laboratory settings, particularly in the field of life sciences and drug discovery.

The SOLO Liquid Handler offers precise and accurate liquid handling capabilities, enabling researchers to efficiently handle and dispense small volumes of liquids in various applications, such as assay development, high-throughput screening, genomics, proteomics, and drug discovery.

Here are some key features and functionalities of the SOLO Liquid Handler:

- Liquid Handling Arms: The system typically includes one or more robotic arms equipped with specialized liquid handling tools, such as pipetting probes or disposable tips. These arms can move independently, allowing for simultaneous or sequential handling of multiple samples.
- Versatility in Liquid Transfer: The SOLO Liquid Handler can perform a wide range of liquid transfer tasks, including sample dispensing, serial dilutions, plate reformatting, mixing, and plate replication. It offers flexibility in handling various types of microplates, tubes, and other labware.
- Precise Volume Control: The system is capable of dispensing liquids in microliter or nanoliter volumes with high precision and accuracy. This enables reproducibility and eliminates human errors associated with manual pipetting.
- Software Control and Programming: The SOLO Liquid Handler is controlled through software that provides an intuitive user interface for programming liquid handling protocols. Users can define specific parameters, liquid transfer steps, plate maps, and other parameters to automate the desired workflows. The software also offers scheduling and data logging features for efficient experiment management.
- Integration and Compatibility: The system is designed to integrate with various laboratory instruments, such as plate readers, incubators, and shakers. This allows for seamless coordination of workflows and eliminates the need for manual sample transfer between instruments.
- Modular Design: The SOLO Liquid Handler is often designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to customize and expand the system according to their specific needs. Additional modules can be added to enhance functionality, such as plate storage and retrieval systems.
- Safety and Contamination Control: The system incorporates safety features to prevent cross-contamination between samples. It may include features such as disposable tips, UV sterilization, and liquid level sensing to ensure accurate and contamination-free liquid handling.
