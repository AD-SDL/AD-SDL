### Automation of OT-2 Calibration

Biological protocols can be run via a python API on the Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, but the calibration of the OT-2 is performed in an interactive session, preventing the development of fully autonomous workflows. This project aims to develop an automated calibration method using microswitches and an Arduino microcontroller. The Python-based utility will calibrate the pipette followed by the calibration of the deck.
