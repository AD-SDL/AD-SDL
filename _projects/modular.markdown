### Modular Robotics for Science

Scientific workflows often rely on domain specific instruments. This project aims to engineer ""modules"" of commonly required instruments to assemble robotic experimentation platforms for certain scientific workflows. This project will encompass both the hardware and software aspects of developing new modules. 

At first approach, the modules will replace already existing instruments to minimize the utilization gap. Furthermore, new instruments will be introduced and new scientific workflows purely based on the modules. The student will also be linked with domain scientists to bridge the gap between development and real-life utilization.
