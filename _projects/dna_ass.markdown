### DNA Assembly Protocol Development

DNA Assembly is the method of physically linking together fragments of DNA, in an end-to-end fashion, to achieve a desired, higher-order assembly prior to joining to a vector.  This is one of the most important protocols in molecular biology and will be a vital capability of our larger autonomous laboratory in the future. There are also several existing projects at Argonne that would benefit greatly from this AI enabled DNA Assembly protocol. For now, this protocol will be developed on the Hudson robotic platform in building 446. In the future, we would like to move this protocol to a more open-source robotic platform like the ones that are being developed in the Rapid Prototyping Lab in building 240.
