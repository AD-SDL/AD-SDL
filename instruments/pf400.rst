PF400
===================

The PF400, developed by Precise Automation, is a 6-axis robotic arm with servo gripper that is ideal for automating sample handling in both benchtop and automated laboratory environments. It is a collaborative robot that includes safety features for disabling motor power when a minimal, unexpected force is encountered, thus allowing the PF400 to operate safely alongside researchers. In the Rapid Prototyping Lab, the PF400 is placed at the center of the modular workcell to facilitate the transfer of microplates between the other instruments in the experiment.
