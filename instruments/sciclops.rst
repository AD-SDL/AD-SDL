SciClops Microplate Handler
===========================

The SciClops Microplate Handler, developed by Hudson Robotics, is a robotic arm designed to transfer microplates between locations along a circular path in an automated experimentation platform. While the SciClops is very similar to the Hudson PlateCrane EX in appearance and ability, this newer model has an extended reach and includes a camera on the underside of the gripper for automatic calibration. This robotic arm can also access storage stacks, aiding in the replenishment of labware to the automated laboratory system.
