Opentrons OT2
===================

The OT-2 is an open-source automated liquid handling robot developed by Opentrons. It is used to automated repetitive laboratory tasks such as pipetting and the timed heating, cooling, and shaking of microplates. The OT-2 utilizes a range of single-channel and multi-channel pipettes to accurately transfer liquids in microliter volumes. Additionally, the 11 available deck positions can accommodate a wide range of labware such as microplates, tube racks, tip racks, and reservoirs. The OT-2 is particularly useful for life science research in areas such as genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and synthetic biology because it can perform tasks such as PCR setup, serial dilutions, plate replication, and sample normalization.
