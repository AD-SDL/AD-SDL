UR5e
===================

The UR5e, developed by Universal Robots, is a robotic arm with a payload capacity of 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and a reach radius of 850 millimeters (33.5 inches), making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It is also a collaborative robot (cobot) designed to be safe when used alongside human operators. Although the UR5e is most often used for pick and place operations, Universal Robots provides a wide range of accessories, grippers, and software options to enhance the capabilities and compatibility of the UR5e. In the Rapid Prototyping Laboratory, the UR5e is placed on top of a MiR250 base and together the two robots are create a mobile robot that can be used for the transfer of supplies to and from a workcell.
